# Glioblastona-RNA-seq
This was a group project adapted from an example RNA seq project from the Costa lab found here: https://www.costalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R_class_D3.html#2_TCGA_data.
This project uses data normalization Net Elastic Model, PCA analysis, and glimma pipeline to perform RNA seq analysis on clinical and genetic data 
taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA study GBM https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-GBM). Used this data to find which genes mutations contributed to clinical
outcomes of gliboblastoma multiforme.
